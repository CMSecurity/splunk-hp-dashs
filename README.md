# Splunk HP Dashboards
These dashboards can be imported by creating a new dashboard, selecting "Source" in the editor and pasting the XML in question.  
**Please be advised that these dashboards probably won't work out of the box with your infrastructure!**  
Treat these not as production-ready dasboards but more as inspiration to spin up your own.  
All queries in these boards search for data in the index named "honeypots".
